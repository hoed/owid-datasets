# National poverty lines (Jolliffe et al., 2022)

Harmonized national poverty lines, expressed as income or consumption per person per day in 2017 international-$.

As a part of the process of setting the International Poverty Line used by the UN and the World Bank as its definition of extreme poverty, Jolliffe et al. (2022) created a dataset of the poverty lines adopted nationally in different countries.

Official definitions of poverty in different countries are often not directly comparable due to the different ways poverty is measured. For example, countries account for the size of households in different ways in their poverty measures.

The authors take steps to harmonize national poverty lines, in order to allow for comparisons between these different poverty definitions. They are the poverty line in international-$ which, within the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) data, yields the same poverty rate as the officially reported rate using national definitions in a given year.
