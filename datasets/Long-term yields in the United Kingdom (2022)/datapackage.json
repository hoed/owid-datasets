This comprises crop yield estimates only for England. For this dataset, we have assumed that yields in England are also representative of average UK yields. \n\n– Data from 1870 to 1960 is taken from Brassley (2000. This is provided over 5-year periods. We have assumed these figures for the first year in each 5-year set.\n\n– Data from 1961 onwards is sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nReferences:\nBroadberry, S., Campbell, B.
