This is measured in metric tonnes.\n\nIt comes two datasets.\n\nData from 1950 to 2015 is taken directly from the work of Geyer et al. (2017), published in the journal Science Advances.\nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782.full\n\nThe data point for 2019 comes from the work of the OECD Global Plastics Outlook (available here: https://doi.org/10.1787/efff24eb-en).\n\nSince estimates of plastic production were not available for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, Our World in Data have estimated these figures based the assumption of a 5% annual growth rate in production. This growth rate was estimated based on the annual growth rates in the last decade of the Geyer et al. (2017) dataset. Assumptions of a 5% growth rate also match closely with the OECD's 2019 figures.",
