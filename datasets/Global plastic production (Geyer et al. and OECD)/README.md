# Global plastic production (Geyer et al. and OECD)

This data measures plastic production as the sum of polymer resin and fiber production. This is measured in metric tonnes.

It comes two datasets.

Data from 1950 to 2015 is taken directly from the work of Geyer et al. (2017), published in the journal Science Advances.

The data point for 2019 comes from the work of the OECD Global Plastics Outlook (available here: https://doi.org/10.1787/efff24eb-en).

Since estimates of plastic production were not available for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, Our World in Data have estimated these figures based the assumption of a 5% annual growth rate in production. This growth rate was estimated based on the annual growth rates in the last decade of the Geyer et al. (2017) dataset. Assumptions of a 5% growth rate also match closely with the OECD's 2019 figures.
