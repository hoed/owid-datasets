The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) publishes annual data on the number and quantities of oil spilled from tankers globally.

The latest report from the ITOPF is published here: https://www.itopf.org/fileadmin/uploads/itopf/data/Documents/Company_Lit/Oil_Spill_Stats_2021.pdf

We have extracted the data from the published tables of annual statistics.

Decadal figures are given as the total, or annual average over the ten years starting at the decadal base year: for example, the figures for the 1990s is the 10 years from 1990 (inclusive) to 1999.
