# Number of people with and without energy access (OWID based on World Bank, 2021)

This was calculated by Our World in Data based on estimates the share of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking – published by the World Bank – and total population estimates from the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP). 

Original metrics of energy access shares and total population can be accessed from the World Bank World Development Indicators (available at: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators).
