  "description": "This study included samples more than 12 million litter items retrieved from 7 major river and ocean environments globally. To build such a large inventories of macro-litter items, the authors compiled a total of 36 datasets providing counts of litter by item typology in river waters and riverbed, shoreline, nearshore waters (<100 km from shoreline) and nearshore seafloor (<100 m depth, <100 km from shoreline), open waters (>100 km from shoreline) and deep seafloor (>100 m depth, >100 km from shoreline).\n\nThese litter items were classified according to their material composition, type of product and probable origin.\n\nOn average, 80% of the items were made of plastic, followed by metal (7% ± 7%), glass (5% ± 6%) and fabric (3% ± 3%).\n\nThis data by region is shown as the share of items in nearshore waters (<100 km from the shoreline).",
