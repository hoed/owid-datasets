# Supercomputer power (FLOPS) â€“ TOP500 Database

Data on supercomputer power is sourced from the TOP500 database, which tracks and reports the 500 largest supercomputers bi-annually. 

Supercomputer power is measured in Floating-Point Operations per Second (FLOPS), a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small numbers, or computations requiring an extensive dynamic range. Therefore, it is a more accurate measurement than instructions per second.
