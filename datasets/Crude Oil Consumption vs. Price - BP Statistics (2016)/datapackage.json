  "description": "Oil consumption data is based on reported global daily consumption. This includes crude oil, shale oil, oil sands and Natural Gas Liquids (the gas component of which is treated separately and not included).\n\nOil prices are based on average crude oil prices as the Arabian Light series from 1965-1983 and Brent dated series from 1984-2015. This is reported in 2015 US$ per cubic meter (deflated by BP Energy Review using the Consumer Price Index for the US).\n\nTo convert from barrels to cubic meters, we use a factor of 0.159, following BP's definitions.",
