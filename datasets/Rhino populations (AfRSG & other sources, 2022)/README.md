# Rhino populations (AfRSG & other sources, 2022)

Data was compiled by Our World in Data based on a number of historical sources. Data is based on best estimates: there is greater uncertainty in earlier historical data but is provided as the best estimate of the time. 

The main data source for rhino populations is the African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups (AfRSG). AfRSG periodically produce the latest estimates of rhino populations in Africa and Asia, in update reports of their status. The available literature from AfRSG can be accessed at: http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=refs.

Where a range of values are reported in the above document we report the central value. This is only the case for rhino population estimates in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Citation of the latest report is as follows:

Where estimates from AfRSG is available, we have used its data. However, we have also combined these statistics with earlier estimates from multiple academic sources. These include:
