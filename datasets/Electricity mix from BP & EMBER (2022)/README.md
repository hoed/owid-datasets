# Electricity mix from BP & EMBER (2022)

Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on three main sources: 
– BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
– Ember Global Electricity Review (2022): https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/global-electricity-review-2022/
- Ember European Electricity Review (2022): https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2022/

Ember compile their global dataset from various sources including:
– Eurostat: Annual European generation and import data, and monthly data in some cases where better sources are not available.
– ENTSO-E: Monthly European generation and import data.
– EIA: Annual global generation and import data.
– UN: Monthly global generation data in some cases.
– GEM: Annual global coal and gas capacity data.
– IRENA: Annual global capacity data for all non-fossil fuel types, and for Other Fossil where available.
– WRI: Annual global capacity data for Other Fossil where other sources are not available.
– European carbon intensities rely on data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).

Electricity mix data from BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data. BP provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) versus only 1990 from Ember. However, BP does not provide data for all countries and is not as up-to-date as Ember data. So, where data from Ember is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from BP where it's not available.

Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity production.
