  "description": "The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an international measure of acute multidimensional poverty covering over 100 developing countries. It complements traditional monetary poverty measures by capturing the acute deprivations in health, education, and living standards that a person faces simultaneously.\n\n<h4>How is multidimensional poverty defined?</h4>\nBeing ‘MPI poor’ means that a person is deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, grouped into three dimensions: \n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Health</strong> – using two indicators: nutrition, child mortality \n    <li><strong>Education</strong> – using two indicators: years of schooling, school attendance\n    <li><strong>Living standards</strong> – using five indicators: cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets.</li>\n</ul>\nHouseholds are assessed as being deprived in a given indicator if they do not meet a certain threshold for that indicator. For instance, a household is deprived in the <em>Years of schooling</em> indicator if no household member has completed six years of schooling. A person is considered deprived in the <em>Cooking fuel</em> indicator if they cook using solid fuel, such as dung, agricultural crops, wood, charcoal, or coal. The thresholds for each indicator are published by OPHI in their <a href=\"https://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/OPHI_MPI_MN_54_2022.pdf\">methodological notes</a>.\n\nThe individual indicators are not ‘weighted’ equally: When adding up the number of indicators in which a person is deprived, some count for more than others. Health and education indicators are given a weight of 1/6, while the indicators within the living standards dimension are given a weight of 1/18. This means that the three dimensions – health, education and living standards – have an equal weight in the total of one-third each.\n\nIf the household survey data being used is missing any of the 10 indicators, that indicator is dropped from the calculation. The weights are then adjusted so that each dimension continues to be given a weight of one-third. MPI poverty estimates are only calculated if at least one indicator in each dimension is available.\n\nThe global MPI was developed by OPHI with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) for inclusion in UNDP’s flagship Human Development Report in 2010. It has been published annually by OPHI and in the HDRs ever since.\n\nThis is the CME dataset, with \"current margin estimates\", which are essentially the regular global MPI in OPHI's publications.",

For instance, a household is deprived in the <em>Years of schooling</em> indicator if no household member has completed six years of schooling. A person is considered deprived in the <em>Cooking fuel</em> indicator if they cook using solid fuel, such as dung, agricultural crops, wood, charcoal, or coal.

Health and education indicators are given a weight of 1/6, while the indicators within the living standards dimension are given a weight of 1/18. This means that the three dimensions – health, education and living standards – have an equal weight in the total of one-third each.\n\nIf the household survey data being used is missing any of the 10 indicators, that indicator is dropped from the calculation.

This is an important complementary measure to the share of the population who are MPI poor (the 'incidence' of MPI poverty). An example given by the researchers who calculate the MPI data serves to illustrate this well: \n\n'Imagine two countries: in both, 30 percent of people are poor (incidence). Judged by this piece of information, these two countries are equally poor. However, imagine that in one of the two countries poor people are deprived—on average—in one-third of the dimensions, whereas in the other country, the poor are deprived—on average—in two-thirds. By combining the two pieces of information - the intensity of deprivations and the proportion of poor people - we know that these two countries are not equally poor, but rather that the second is poorer than the first because the intensity of poverty is higher.'\n\nThe Multidimensional Poverty Index, being the product of the incidence and intensity of multidimensional poverty, reflects both.",
