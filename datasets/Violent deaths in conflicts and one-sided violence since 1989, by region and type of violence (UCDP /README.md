# Violent deaths in conflicts and one-sided violence since 1989, by region and type of violence (UCDP 2022)

This data counts civilian and military deaths in conflicts and one-sided violence. The data counts only direct violent deaths (i.e. excluding deaths from disease or famine).

It is based on the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 21.1. This presents deaths estimates for individual events. We aggregate deaths across years, broken down by conflict/violence type and by region.
