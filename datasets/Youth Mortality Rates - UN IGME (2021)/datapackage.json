  "description": "Youth Mortality Rates measures the share of newborns who die before reaching a given age. This dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME).\n\nWe define and calculate the 'youth mortality' for different age cut-offs based on the combination of different metrics:\n\n- Under-ten mortality rate: \n    - Under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)\n    -  5-9 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 9).\n\n- Under-fifteen mortality rate: \n    - Under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)\n    -  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 14).\n\n- Under-twenty mortality rate: \n    - Under-15 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of fifteen)\n    -  15-19 mortality rates (the share of children aged 15 who die before reaching the age of 19).\n\n- Under-twenty-five mortality rate: \n    - Under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)\n    -  5-24 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 24).\n\nAll of these metrics are available from the UN IGME (2021). This dataset should be next updated by the source in December 2022. We will update it on Our World in Data soon after the new version is published. At the link above you can directly access the source page and see the latest available data.",
