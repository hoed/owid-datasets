# Non-commercial flight distance records - Wikipedia

This data has been sourced from the compilation of flight distance records on Wikipedia. References to the individual sources for each record can be found at this link.

Only non-commercial powered aircraft are included in this dataset, which contains only those flights taken without mid-flight refueling.

Where more than one record was set in any given year, only the highest of the given year has been included here.
