# NIH - DNA Sequencing Costs

The NHGRI program describes genome sequencing costs relative to two metrics, quoted below:

"(1) "Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence" - the cost of determining one megabase (Mb; a million bases) of DNA sequence of a specified quality;

(2) "Cost per Genome" - the cost of sequencing a human-sized genome."

Cost data from the NHGRI is presented bi-annually or seasonally for each year. We have summarized this data annually by calculating the lowest yearly cost.
