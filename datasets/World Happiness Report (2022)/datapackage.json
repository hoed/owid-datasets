The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”\n\nThe value shown in a given year is the average of that year and the previous and following year. For example, the value given for 2020 is an average of the values for 2019-2021.\n\nThis dataset should be next updated by the source in April 2023.
