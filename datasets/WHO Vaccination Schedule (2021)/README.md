# WHO Vaccination Schedule (2021)

This dataset shows vaccines that are administered through national immunization schedules: where countries provide and recommend vaccines through routine services. This does not mean all children are vaccinated – countries vary in their vaccination coverage. 

The category 'Not routinely administered' does not necessarily mean the vaccines are unavailable – they may be optional or available commercially, but they are not included in the national immunization schedule.
