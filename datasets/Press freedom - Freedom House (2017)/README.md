# Press freedom - Freedom House (2017)

This dataset provides information on press freedoms, using data from Freedom House's (2017) Freedom of the Press.

For the years 1979-1987, we use the worse classification across the two dimensions of print and broadcast media. 

For the data covering January 1981 to August 1982 we code the year 1982, and for the data covering August 1982 to November 1983 we code the year 1983.

We show the data for Czechoslovakia as Czechia, for the USSR as Russia, and for Yugoslavia as Serbia.
