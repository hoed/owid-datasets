  "description": "This dataset aggregates the number of conflicts per year (by conflict type and region) listed in UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 21.1.\n\nConflicts within this dataset refer only to 'State-based' conflicts. UCDP defines state-based armed conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns\ngovernment and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”\n\nThe conflict is listed in all years that the 25 deaths threshold is met (but not otherwise).\n\nThe data is organised by year and conflict. We aggregate this to provide the number of conflicts in each year, broken down by the conflict type and region. \nThis dataset runs from 1946 and aims to have global coverage over this period. Accordingly, we add a zero deaths observation for year-region-conflict type combinations that do appear in the dataset.\n\nThe labels for the conflict types we have used paraphrase UCDP/PRIO's technical definitions of 'Extrasystemic', 'Internal', 'Internationalised internal' and 'Interstate'.\n\nNote that in this dataset the location refers not (necessarily) to where fighting and deaths took place, but rather to the location of the 'incompatibility' between the participants that defines the conflict: usually the country or territory whose possession or governance is in dispute.\n",
