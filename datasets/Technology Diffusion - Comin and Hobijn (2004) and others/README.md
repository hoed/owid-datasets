# Technology Diffusion - Comin and Hobijn (2004) and others

A similar dataset was previously assembled by Horace Dediu, who writes at: http://www.asymco.com/author/asymco/. We are thankful for Horace Dediu's generosity in making his dataset available. We have tracked down all of his sources and assembled our dataset based on these sources. 

The latest update to the dataset is detailed <a href="https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2022/06/Tech_Adoption_Update_documentation-2.xlsx">here (ver 27.07.19)</a>. We thank Adam Ferris for his help in collating this data.
