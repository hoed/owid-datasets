# Democracy and Human rights - OWID based on Varieties of Democracy (v13) and Regimes of the World

This dataset provides information on democracy and human rights, using data from the Varieties of Democracy project (v13), and the Regimes of the World classification by LÃ¼hrmann et al. (2018).

We expand the countries and years covered, and refine the coding of the Regimes of the World classification. You can read a detailed description of the data in these posts:
