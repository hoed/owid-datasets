# Electricity mix from BP & EMBER (2022) - archive

Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on three main sources: 
– BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
– Ember: https://ember-climate.org/data/
- Ember European Electricity Review (2022): https://ember-climate.org/project/european-electricity-review-2022/

We also include European carbon intensities (gCO2/kWh) from Ember: https://ember-climate.org/project/eu-power-sector-2020/. The underlying source for much of this data is the European Environment Agency: https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/greenhouse-gas-emission-intensity-of-1 

Electricity mix data from BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data, meaning energy and electricity data is consistent from the same source. It provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) versus only 2000 from Ember. However, BP does not provide data for all countries and is not as up-to-date as Ember data.

So, where data from Ember is available for a given country or year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from BP where it's not available.

2021 electricity data is currently only available for European countries based on the latest European Electricity Review.

Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity production.
