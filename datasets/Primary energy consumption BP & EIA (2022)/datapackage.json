  "description": "Primary energy consumption data was compiled by Our World in Data based on two key data sources: \n1. BP Statistical Review of World Energy: https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\n2. International data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA): https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/total-energy/more-total-energy-data\n\nBP provides the longest and most up-to-date time-series of primary energy. However, it does not provide data for all countries. We have therefore supplemented this dataset with energy data from the EIA. Where BP provides data for a given country, this data is adopted; for countries where this data is missing, we rely on EIA Energy figures.\n\nPer capita figures have been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on different sources:\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/population-sources\n\nTo calculate energy per unit of GDP, we use total real GDP figures from the Maddison Project Database, version 2020: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2020\nThis dataset is based on Bolt, Jutta and Jan Luiten van Zanden (2020), “Maddison style estimates of the evolution of the world economy. A new 2020 update ”. GDP is measured in 2011$ which are PPP-adjusted.",
